First and foremost, Root (version 5.20 or better) must be installed on the machine you wish to install this code on.  this code should also be compiled using the same compilerthat was used for root.  

To install, run ./make.sh which will build and link the necessary libraries to interface with root, and then build the program that converts the .evt files to .root files.  This will also compile a basic program to read the root files and display the data.

The program to convert evt files to root files is called Make_EVT_Tree
To run this program call ./Make_EVT_Tree <evt file> <verbosity>  from the command line.  Where <evt file> is the .evt file to be converted, and <verbosity> is an integer flag to determine output.  if verbosity is greater than 0, values are printed to the screen as they are read, if verbosity is 0, no output is printed.  If verbosity is set to -1, the program will output the results of the endianness test.  Verbosity defaults to 0, so if no screen output is desired, you can simply run ./Make_EVT_Tree <evt file>.  The .root file will be stored in the same directory as the .evt file, and will have the same name, but with a .root extension.  There have been some recent changes to the format of the header for the .evt files.  Make_EVT_Tree will properly convert .evt files with an event builder version of 4.3 (this can be checked in the <run>_settings.xml file in each runs directory.  At some point the porgram will use the xml file to handle this format change, but this is not implemented yet.

The program to read the root file is called read_tree.  
To run this program call ./read_tree <root file> from the command line.  This program will scan through the <root file> and print all the values it reads to the terminal.  It will also save gifs of all the pulse traces in the file in a directory called plots (this directory must exist before read_tree is run).  The pulse traces will be named pulse_hist_<event number>_<channel number>_<pulse number>.gif.
