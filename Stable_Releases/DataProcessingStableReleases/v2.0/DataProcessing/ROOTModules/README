This Livetime module is a basic module people can use to test if they can run
the data processing framework. It does the following:

1) Access all of the .evt files in the specified directory in
      run_dp_framework_matlabless.py.
2) Read each .evt and calculate the livetime.
3) Print to screen the livetime. This output is snagged by the framework
      so you won't actually see it.
4) Write a ".rq" file. This file is nothing but the livetime in ascii.


The livetime module can be compiled with "make" in LivetimeModule folder. It
can be run standalone with a command like:



./Livetime <evt folder> <a single evt file> <rq folder> <a single rq file>

E.G.

./Livetime /home/mwoods/evts/lux10_20120000T0000/ lux10_20120000T0000_f0000001.evt /home/mwoods/rqs/lux10_20120000T0000/ lux10_20120000T0000_f0000001.rq
