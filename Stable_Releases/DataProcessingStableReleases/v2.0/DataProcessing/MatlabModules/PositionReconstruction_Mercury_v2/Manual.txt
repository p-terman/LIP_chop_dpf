There are two xml files that are needed to reconstruct the data. The
reconstruction settings is part of the data processing  settings
file and deals with the different settings that can be applied to the
reconstruction of the data. The second file is an IQ settings xml
script and stores all the information related with the result and
calculation of the light reponse functions - LRF thereafter.

Chapter I : ON THE DATA PROCESSING SETTINGS FILE

The current settings of the data processing files are the following

a) verbosity
<verbose>int</verbose> : sets the correct verbosity
1: Just print warning and errors
2: Print the reconstructed positions for each event
3: Not implemented yet but it will print everything that I can remember

b) equalization
<equalization>1</equalization>

0: The equalization will not be applied (not Implemented yet)
1: The top array will be equalized using the variable lug_iqs_xml

c) estimative of the initial position 
<getapproximatedposition>GessTri</getapproximatedposition>

To work properly mercury requires a rough estimative of the initial
position of the event. The options available for this field are

GessTri

d) Minimization method
<minimization_method>fminunc</minimization_method>
Several minimization methods using different matlab functions can be
used. 

fminunc:  unconstrained nonlinear optimization with derivative calculation.
fminsearch: unconstrained nonlinear optimization.
fmincon: constrained nonlinear optimization.

e) Reconstruction method
<reconstruction_method>lookuptable</reconstruction_method>
This field needs some improvement. Basically, we have two different
manners to describe the LRF, - the functional method and the spline
method. However the functional method is splitted in two because the
old method was too slow. Right now we have the following  
functional: It computes the expected response for each PMT and for
each event and minimization iteraction. It is very slow and should be
using for debugging or if you need to use a computer as a heater.
lookuptable: This selection still uses the functional method to
describe the splines but the functions are mapped into a
look-up-table.
splines: splines are used to describe the LRFs.

f) standard deviation
<compute_sd>1</compute_sd>
The computation of the standard deviation using the chi2
curves. Please take into account that this computation will reduce the
speed of the reconstruction.
The following options can be selected:
0: the standard deviation are calculated
1: the standard deviations are not calculated

g: cut the zero photons data
<cutzerophotonsdata>1</cutzerophotonsdata>
Which means:
1: The photomultipliers with no signal observed are not used in the reconstruction
0: The selection of the PMTs that are used in the reconstruction does
not take into consideration the existence of signal. NOT WELL TESTED

h: maximum distance between the PMT and event
<maximum_distance_PMTevent>20</maximum_distance_PMTevent>
This takes into consideration the distance between the centre of the
PMT and the position of the event using a rougher method, excluding
the PMTs that are too far from the event and have no impact or a
negative impact in the reconstruction. The current default distance
used is 20 cm and it seems to be the optimal distance for our detector.

i: minimum number of PMTs with signal
<min_top_pmts_with_signal>7</min_top_pmts_with_signal>
This number corresponds to the minimum number of top PMTs which
observed any signal. A lower number is not recomendable because the
current rough computation of the position of the event does not work
in these conditions.

f: border minimization
<border_minimization>Multiple</border_minimization>
The events near the walls are difficult to reconstruct. The rough
estimative of the position of the event is usually bad and on the top
of that the chi square function can exhibit more than one minima in
this region. To avoid this undesirable feature I have created a
multiple minimization method that takes into consideration several
positions of the event. This option can be turned on/off by the user
and as usual it slows the reconstruction. 
0: Single munimization
1: Multiple minimization

g: multiple minimization start radius
<multiple_minimization_start_point>20</multiple_minimization_start_point>
Above this point the multiple minimization method is applied.


h: Plot positions
<plot_positions>Iterative</plot_positions>
The user has the option to plot the position of the reconstructed
event during the reconstruction process. The two options are
Iterative:
NonIterative

i: PMTs selected
This is a vector with 122 elements which indicates which PMTs are
going to be used in the reconstruction.
